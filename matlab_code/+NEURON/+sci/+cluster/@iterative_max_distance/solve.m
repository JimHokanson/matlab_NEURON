%At this point we have a vector which contains the smallest distance to a
%"chosen" point. The algorithm now involves:
%1) Going through and finding the point whose min value is the largest, in
%other words, who is the furthest away from any previously chosen point
%2) Adjusting other points so that if they are closer to this new point
%than previously chosen points, updating the
%       smallest_distance_to_a_chosen_point
%accordingly so that it holds the distance
%to this new point, and not whichever previously chosen point they were
%previously bound to.
%
%Importantly, this doesn't need to be an exhaustive search because at all
%times we know the largest distance between an "unknown" or "unchosen"
%point and all previously chosen points. Thus, once we encounter distances
%between this newly chosen points and other points we can stop as they
%will never be closer to the newly chosen point than they are to some other
%already chosen point, otherwise, the maximum distance to a chosen point
%would be incorrect. Put loosely in code this is:
%
%   next_point = index of max (minimum distances from unchosen to chosen points)
%
%   cur_max_distance = distance value at next_point index
%
%   At this point, all unchosen points are are within cur_max_distance
%   of at least one chosen point
%
%   Next: Update min_distance values accordingly given that next_point
%   is now considered to be chosen
%
%   smallest_distance_to_a_chosen_point =
%           min(smallest_distance_to_a_chosen_point,distance to next_point)
%
%   IMPORTANTLY:
%   If we had a sorted list of distances from the point to others, we could
%   stop once we get larger than cur_max_distance, because the other
%   points would never satisfy the minimum comparison above, i.e.
%
%   min(smallest_distance_to_a_chosen_point,distance to next_point)
%
%   to do so would mean that the next_point choice above was invalid ...
%
%   We use knnsearch to form a partially sorted list of smallest distances.
%   If the max occurs within this list, we can stop. If not, we must
%   compute the distance from this point to all other points ...
