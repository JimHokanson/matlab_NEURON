function act_obj = sim__getActivationVolume(obj,max_scale)

%NOTE: The max scale could be optional
%perhaps this only creates the activation volume object
%which is then responsible for handling things ...

%{
Step 1: Get activation volume - how to do this?????
    - get distances from all electrodes
    - only concerned about transverse distances ...???
        - this should be an option - i.e. assume axon stimulation for now
            but make this assumption explicit ...

Step 2: Request thresholds????
    - how do we know if we are fine enough ????
    - should this be taken care of completely by the threshold predictor???

Step 3:
