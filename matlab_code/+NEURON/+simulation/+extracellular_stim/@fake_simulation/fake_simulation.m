    %   Class: 
    %       NEURON.simulation.extracellular_stim.fake_simulation       
    %
    %   The main goal of this class is to allow the following:
    %   Given a predictor algorithm and some xstim setup, compute the
    %   time it takes to evaluate a set of points and how off the results
    %   are from previous data.
    %
    %   The main difference from current classes is that we would need to
    %   work with new OR old data. We could also do some cross validation.
    %
    %   I need to put some more thought into what I would like out of this
    %   class ...
