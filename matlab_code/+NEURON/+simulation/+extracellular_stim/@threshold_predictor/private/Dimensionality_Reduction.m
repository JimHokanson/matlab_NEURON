Dimensionality reduction in the predictor object.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I dislike having dimensionality reduction of the applied stimuli being in
the predictor object but it is possible that the predictor object may
change the dimensionality reduction approach so as to facilitate threshold
prediction.
