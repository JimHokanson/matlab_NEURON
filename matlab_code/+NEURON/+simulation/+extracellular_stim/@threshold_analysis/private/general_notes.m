Threshold analysis notes:


    %THRESHOLD ANALYSIS
    %======================================================================
    %Things to know:
    %----------------------------------------------------------------------
    %1) Anything above threshold
    %2) Fried tissue
    %3) Highest subthreshold response - i.e. if we have nothing, what is
    %       the maximum potential that was reached? This may have
    %       predictive purposes ...
    %4) Was a certain area above threshold - i.e. to test propogation
    
    %Cases
    %----------------------------------------------------------------------
    %1) A.P. but propogation failure:
    %      - due to lack of simulation time, AP should propogate
    %      - due to anodal block phenomena
    %      - NOTE: We could eventually try and differentiate between these
    %      two but we would need to rely on stim times ...
    %
    %2) No AP
    %      - insufficient stimulus
