Definitions:
MDF - modified driving functions
    MDF1 - "single node method" 

Axon Diameters  - 4 to 20 um
Pulse Durations - 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 ms

Activation Thresholds:
Step 1 - unique set extracellular voltage vectors (Bottom Left Page 3)
    1) Ve - 0 to -500 mV
    2) Second Diff: 0 to 190 mV
    3) Both in 10 mV steps, to yield 1020 unique vectors
    4) This specifies the 3 center points ????
        ??? - assuming symmetric stimulation
    5) Transition to flat potential at outer most nodes???
        ??? - 0 potential or fix based on trying to match monopolar stimulation?
    6) Apply to fiber diameters of 4 - 20 microns
    7) Apply with monophasic pulse durations between 20 and 10000 us
Step 2 - plot as a function of:
    1) Axon diameter
    2) pulse duration
    3) axis 1 - Ve
    4) axis 2 - methods's mdf of potential vector
