Discussed in Chapters 9 & 10 of NEURON book

Comments:
1) COMMENT { } ENDCOMMENT
2) : character

It appears that with Notepad++ the : character must have a space after it to be 
properly considered a comment (for highlighting), even though the parser has 
no such restriction 











Some old notes:

COMMENT
{
--
Special variables to NEURON such as celsius, area, v, etc. if used in a model should be declared as parameters
These are variables which are set by the user and not changed by the model itself

%Can they be changed by the user in a model if they wanted to from the default?

DESIGN FLOW


INPUT PARAMETERS
-------------------------------------
- need to specifiy celsius, and maybe ena and el, not sure

nai=13.74  nao=114.5  ki=120 ko=2.5
{celsius=20  secondorder=2 dt=.025}




NEURON -> need to be set
PARAMETER
STATE
ASSIGNED 

THEN
INITIAL -> set state variables to some value, probably their value at inf
-> use procedure that calls alpha and beta, then defines taus and inf, use table function

BREAKPOINT
- calls appropriate derivative
  - derivative updates the alphas and betas, and the taus and inf, then updates the derivative values
- sets the current equations using the states



suffix fh -> used with insert

outward total current carried by this ion, iion; internal and external concentrations 
of this ion, ioni and iono; and reversal potential of this ion, eion

USEION ionname Read Parameters WRITE

NONSPECIFIC_CURRENT -> what does this do?

FUNCTION's written in a model are global and may be used in other models if they do not involve range variables.
It is extremely important that mechanisms have consistent units. To ensure this use the modlunit exexcutable
