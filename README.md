# Matlab <==> NEURON Interface #

This code has the following goals:

1. To allow easier access/modification of NEURON code parameters through Matlab
2. To support code reuse through a (somewhat) organized code base.

At this point the majority of code focuses on modeling extracellular stimulation of a neuron.
