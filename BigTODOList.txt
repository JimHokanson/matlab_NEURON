1) Create a debug class to explore variables ...
2) Create reload NEURON code functions ...
3) Selectively load libraries given simulation type
4) Implement intracellular stim simulation

1) DONE Move everything to GIT - finish dependency moving code
2) DONE Fix threshold function
3) DONE Finish moving extracellular stim code out of MRG .hoc code
4) DONE (sort of) On error, stop simulation, don't continue it ... Currently dbquit is usually followed by a lot more code running ...
